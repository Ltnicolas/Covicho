GitHub Test

Simple testing of github functionality through VSCode and some basic HTML syntaxis with humorous content in Spanish, 
  supposedly about preventing Coronavirus lol







DO try this at home, both the hand-washing AND the github+HTML practice.



And yes... my grandma codes better.








































Just kidding, she was older than the ENIAC.
Love you, Grandma! RIP <3
